THIS IS PULL REQUEST TEMPLATE

Referencing issues and pull requests
You can bring up a list of suggested issues and pull requests within the repository by typing #. 
Type the issue or pull request number or title to filter the list, and then press either tab or enter to complete the highlighted result.

For more information, see "Autolinked references and URLs."

Referencing external resources
If custom autolink references are configured for a repository, then references to external resources, like a JIRA issue or Zendesk ticket, convert into shortened links. 
To know which autolinks are available in your repository, contact someone with admin permissions to the repository. 
For more information, see "Configuring autolinks to reference external resources."
